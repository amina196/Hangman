This repository contains the code for a very simplistic hangman game in Python. No UI. 
Aim : get familiar with the Python syntax and data structures. 

How to play ?! 
- clone the repo from Git 
- cd into the folder imported 
- run "python hangman.py" 

You should be good to go. 

Feel free to augment the list of possible words, only a few are there.

Have fun !
